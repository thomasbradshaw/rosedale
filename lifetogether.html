        <h2>What to Expect</h2>
        <p>
          If you come to church, you can expect a congregation full of smiling faces and extended hands.
          Worship service begins at 10:00am and lasts approximately one hour. After worship, visitors are invited to stay
          for refreshments &amp; fellowship.
        </p>
        <h2>Dress</h2>
        <p>
          You will see a variety of dress on a Sunday morning. A few will be dressed in their Sunday best,
          while others will be wearing more casual clothes. Whatever the case, please just come as you are,
          and come as you are most comfortable.
        </p>

            <div style="font-size:x-large">Kids</div><br />
            At Rosedale, we like actual kids - the kind that don't sit still, that make noise, and ask
            unusual questions. There is a Children's message as well as Sunday School during the service.
            All children are welcome to attend Sunday School or stay in the service with a responsible adult.
          </p>
        <h2>Piano Music</h2>
        <p>
          The music style at the church is best described as blended:&nbsp;a bit of classical, jazz, gospel &amp; rock. 
          During the school year, the choir performs a mix of traditional music in addition to many modern selections.
        </p>

        <h2>Communion</h2>
        <p>We celebrate Holy Communion on the first Sunday of every month. All are welcome to partake of the bread and cup. 
           The cup contains non-alcoholic grape juice.
