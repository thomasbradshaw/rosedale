          <h2>A Telling Event</h2>
          <br />
          Here's something you can try at your next family reunion: Ask everyone to remember a particular event, and then let each person tell the story in his or her own words. Whether it's Uncle Harold's wedding, or Sister Susie's graduation, or Cousin Bill's birthday party, what you will probably find is that each person remembers the details a little bit differently. We all notice different things; we naturally fill in any gaps in our recall; and it is not uncommon for different memories to overlap in our minds. It's not that we are being deceptive or deceitful - this is just the way our brains and our memories function.

          Now imagine the early Christians as they tell and retell stories about Jesus' resurrection. Some folks were among the early followers, and these people remember Jesus as an actual earthly person. Others joined later and heard stories told in the faith community. Congregations of believers are separated by many miles; there are, of course, no telephones or electronic recorders; and the stories are not written down in their final form for at least 40 years. So is it any wonder that the resurrection accounts in the four gospels do not agree in every detail?
          <br />
          <br />
          Matthew's gospel tells of an earthquake and a descending angel who rolls away the stone that had sealed Jesus' tomb. In Mark's gospel the two Marys find the stone already moved to one side, and then they see a young man sitting in the tomb. Luke's gospel speaks of two men dressed in dazzling white who explain to the women that Jesus has risen. And John's gospel has Simon Peter and another disciple running to the tomb after Mary Magdalene tells them that she has found it empty. In Matthew's gospel, the women meet the risen Jesus on their way to tell the other disciples. In Mark's gospel the women run away, saying nothing to anyone because they are afraid. (The last verses of Mark's gospel tell of later encounters with the risen Jesus). In Luke's gospel the risen Jesus appears to Cleopas and his companion on the road to Emmaus. And in John's gospel Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene, but she does not recognize him until he calls her name.

          As we can see, the different gospel writers emphasize different aspects of the story, and the specific details do not always agree. But does this mean that the scripture is unreliable? Does it make our faith feel shaky when we realize that the Bible is not like a legal brief that tries to nail down indisputable facts about a particular event or situation?

          It seems to me that facts and truth are not exactly the same thing. Facts can be measured and recorded. Truth is something deeper. You might disagree with other family members about the facts surrounding some event you all remember. Someone thinks it happened in the spring. Someone else is sure it was fall. Someone thinks Grandma was wearing a purple sweater. Someone else says, no, she had on a red dress. But the truth of what happened is something different. The truth might be that we believe it's important to celebrate life's milestones together as a family. The truth might be that we are a family where guests and outsiders are always welcome. The truth is we enjoy each other's company and we love to have fun together.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Easter stories are told in such a way that they tell the truth about Jesus' resurrection. They tell the truth that Jesus is alive, even though people in power tried to get rid of him. They tell the truth that Jesus' followers continue to experience his presence. They tell the truth about the power of God to overcome death.
          <br />
          <br />
          None of us will ever know the exact facts about what happened that first Easter morning. But day by day, and year by year, we can live into the truth of what Easter means for us and for the world. May God bless us this Easter with fresh insight and wonder, as we celebrate truth that we can never completely describe or understand.
